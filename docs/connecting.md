# Connecting to the Robot

1. Turn on the robot by following the instructions [here](/turning-everything-on.md).
2. Turn on your computer and wait until you reach the Windows desktop.
3. Click on the WiFi icon in the bottom right and connect to `RoboConYYYY-TeamXX` where `YYYY` is the competition year and `XX` is your team number. Your WiFi password should be on the bottom of your BrainBox, underneath its network name.
4. Navigate to <http://robot.local> in your web browser of choice (**Chrome** or **Firefox** is recommended). You should see an interface similar to this:

From now on, this will be referred to as the **Shepherd Homepage**.
