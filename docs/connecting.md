# Connecting to the Robot

1. Turn on your tablet and wait until you reach the Windows desktop.
2. Click on the WiFi icon in the bottom right and connect to `robocon-TEAMXX` where `XX` is your team number.
3. Navigate to <http://robot.go> in your web browser of choice (**Chrome** or **Firefox** are recommended). You should see an interface similar to this:

From now on, this will be referred to as the **Shepherd Homepage**.
