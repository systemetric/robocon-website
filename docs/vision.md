# Vision

Computer Vision allows your robots to understand their environment. For the competition, this is used to locate markers. It will give you information about the type of the marker, the distance/angle to the marker, etc.

## Python

To look for markers call `see()`:

```python
markers = R.see()

print(markers)
```

`markers` is a Python list of `marker objects`. Which looks like a the following:

```
[arena Marker 0: 0.856m @0.754 degrees
{
  dist = 0.856
  bearing.y = 0.754
  bearing.x = 1.03e+02
  rotation.y = 5.1
  rotation.x = -11.4
  rotation.z = 9.47
  info = TOO BIG TO PRINT
  detection = TOO BIG TO PRINT
}
]
```

Full reference of the properties are further below but some useful properties are:

| Property           | Description                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `marker.dist`      | Distance to the marker in metres                                   |
| `marker.bearing.y` | The angle your robot needs to turn to get to the marker in degrees |
| `marker.info.id`   | Numeric code of the marker                                         |
| `marker.info.type` | One of `arena` or `cube`                                           |

## Codes

Every april tag has a code:

- April tags 0-39 will be used for cubes. Although each shepherdess only has 6
  sheep to find, there are 9 codes allocated to each team. This is to allow us
  to have spare sheep incase some get damaged during play

- April tags 100+ will around the arena on the walls. See the rules for
  specifics on where around the rules they will be placed

| Codes    | Team  |
| -------- | ----- |
| 100-123   | Arena Marker  |
| 00,20 | Russet jacket potatoes |
| 01,21  | Sweet potatoes jacket potatoes  |
| 02,22 | Maris piper jacket potatoes  |
|03,23| Purple potato jacket potatoes|
|04-19, 24-39| Arena owned hot potatoes |

## Blockly

Blocks for vision can be found in the **Vision** section.

Here's an example of a Blockly program that does some basic vision:

## Example

After reading the [motors documentation](docs/motors.html) you should be able to create a function which moves your robot by a number of meters as well as turn. We can then use this to write some code where a robot:

- Looks for a marker
- If it can see a marker:

  - Turn so that it is facing the marker
  - Drive the distance to the marker

- If there is no marker in sight turn a bit and look again, maybe there is a marker out of view.

```python
import robot

R = robot.Robot()

def move(distance):
    """The robot drives `distance` meters forwards"""
    print("PUT YOUR MOVE CODE HERE")

def turn(rotation):
    """The robot turns `rotation` degrees"""
    print("PUT YOUR TURN CODE HERE")

while True:
    for marker in R.see():
        turn(marker.bearing.y)  # Face the marker
        move(marker.dist)       # Drive to the marker
    else:
        turn(20)  # The robot didn't see anything and so we turn and maybe see
                  # another marker
```

## The `Marker` object

Details about the markers can be accessed using the following syntax:

```python
markers = R.see()  # returns list of markers which the robot can see

for marker in markers:
    print(marker.dist)       # The distance to the marker in meters
    print(marker.bearing.y)  # The rotation the robot would need to turn to
                             # face the marker
    print(marker.info.id)  # The number of the marker
else:
    print("The robot didn't see any markers and skipped the for loop!")
```

A `Marker` object contains information about a _detected_ marker. It has the following attributes:

| Attribute                   | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

You can import `MARKER_OWNER`, `MARKER_TYPE`, `WOOL_TYPE` and `TEAM` from `robot`,   for example...

## The `Camera` object

An interface to the camera is provided incase you want to do additional computer vision.

### Changing the resolution

The default the camera takes pictures at a resolution of **640x480px**. You can change this by setting the `res` parameter.

```python
import robot

R = robot.Robot()

print(f"The current res is set to {R.camera.res}")
R.camera.res = (1920, 1440)
print(f"The current res is set to {R.camera.res}")
```

You must use one of the following resolutions:

- `(640, 480)` _(default)_
- `(1296, 736)`
- `(1296, 976)`
- `(1920, 1088)`
- `(1920, 1440)`

:::tip
Using a higher resolution will increase the amount of time it takes to process the image, but you may be able to see more. Using a smaller resolution will be faster, but markers further away may stop being visible.

### Get data straight from the camera

If you wish to do your own computer vision you can capture frames directly from the camera using `robot.camera.capture()`.

```python
import robot

R = robot.Robot()

image = R.camera.capture()

image.grey_frame # A 2d numpy array of the image data uint8
image.colour_frame # A 3d numpy array of the image data
image.colour_type # The encoding method used to store the colour_frame defaults to 8 bit RGB.
image.time # A `datetime` object representing approximately the capture time.
```

### Using USB cameras

To use a USB camera you will need to initialize the `Robot` with something which inherits from `robot.vision.Camera`. Then just call `R.see()` as you would normally.

```python
import robot
from robot.vision import RoboConUSBCamera

R = robot.Robot(camera=RoboConUSBCamera)

print(R.see())
```

You will then need to calibrate your camera as the distance that it reports will not be accurate. You can do this by changing the value in the `R.camera.params` dictionary up or down.

To get the current value print it:

```python
print(R.camera.params)
R.camera.params[(640, 480)] = (123, 123)
```

We recommend that you tune this value by placing a marker exactly 2m away, printing `R.see()` (remember to take an average), and tuning the focal length up or down until you get a value that is close to 2m. If you are feeling fancy you could even write a function to automatically tune the value.

Calibration data for a Logitech C270 is available:

```python
LOGITECH_C270_FOCAL_LENGTHS = {  # fx, fy tuples
    (640, 480): (607.6669874845361, 607.6669874845361),
    (1296, 736): (1243.0561163806915, 1243.0561163806915),
    (1296, 976): (1232.4906991188611, 1232.4906991188611),
    (1920, 1088): (3142.634753484673, 3142.634753484673),
    (1920, 1440): (1816.5165227051677, 1816.5165227051677)
}
```

This data can be imported:

```python
from robot.vision import LOGITECH_C270_FOCAL_LENGTHS
```
