# The BrainBox

The BrainBox is the core of the kit which we provide. In it is all of the electronics and software you need to power a robot. Lets start by turning it on. Take a battery from the kit and plug the **yellow end** into the corresponding port on the brain box (Labelled "Battery"), ensuring that it is the right way round. Then take a red "power button" and connect that to the **black** connector along the top of the BrainBox. Using the green ended button provided will not work, as this button is momentary and will not maintain power to the BrainBox.

Pressing the start button will cause the blue status LED on the front of the BrainBox to turn on. When the light starts flashing your BrainBox is ready to run code. You can now turn on your tablet by pressing the power button on the left-hand side and [connect to your robot](/connecting.md). The status LED will go solid while code is running.

# How to turn everything off

When you are done for the day, press the power button, the status LED will flash rapidly. When this has turned off you may unplug the battery.

:::warning
Unplugging the battery before the status LED turns off will cause the Pi to lose power before it has finished shutting down which could permanently damage its SD card. **Always** wait till all the lights turn off before unplugging power.
