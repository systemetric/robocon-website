# Getting Started

Welcome to the docs for **Robocon 2020**!

We suggest you first get familiar with the [rules](/docs/rules.md). Once you've done that, you'll need to [turn your robot on](/docs/turning-everything-on.html).

:::tip
You can also access these docs from your robot. Go to <http://robot.go/docs> when you're connected to your robot.
:::

It might also be a good idea to sign up for the [forum](/forum/). You can do this using the registration code provided in your kit. This is a great place to ask questions on anything related to the competition, the kit, or robot programming.
