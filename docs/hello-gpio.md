# GPIO

GPIO, or General Purpose Input Output, is the main way you'll interface with simple or obscure bits of hardware. This tutorial will introduce the GPIO system and how to use it.

## GPIO Pins

On the side of your brainbox, there are 4 regular pins and a "+5v" and "-" pin. The top of the brain box labels which pin corresponds to which number. Different devices need to be plugged into different pins.

## LED Output

If you want to put an LED on your robot, for testing or just for looks, you'll need to plug one side of the LED into the - pin, and the other side of the LED into any regular pin (such as 1). Then, use the following code to set up the pin in `OUTPUT` mode and turn the LED on:

```python
import robot
R = robot.Robot()

# If you're not using GPIO pin 1, change this number to whatever pin you're using.
R.gpio[1].mode = robot.OUTPUT
R.gpio[1].digital = True
```

Try using a loop to make the light turn on and off every 2 seconds. You'll need the time library from the motors exercise.

## Buttons

While your robot hopefully won't be colliding with much, buttons are a good way for a robot to know if it's driven into something. Buttons should be plugged into the - pin and a regular pin (such as 1). Using the `INPUT` mode, you can detect when a button is pressed.

```python
import robot
import time
R = robot.Robot()

# If you're not using GPIO pin 1, change this number to whatever pin you're using.
R.gpio[1].mode = robot.INPUT

while True:
    if R.gpio[1].digital:
        print("Pressed")
    else:
        print("Not Pressed")
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

Try making a light turn on or off depending on if a button is pressed.

## Potentiometers

Another form of input is a potentiometer or a variable resistor. Potentiometers should be plugged into the +5v, a regular pin (such as 3) and the - pin. Using `INPUT_ANALOG` mode, you can read the voltage output of the resistor (between 0V and 5V).

```python
import robot

R = robot.Robot()

POT_PIN = 3

R.gpio[POT_PIN].mode = robot.INPUT_ANALOG

while True:
    print(R.gpio[POT_PIN].analog)
```
