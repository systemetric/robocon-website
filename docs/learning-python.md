# Learning Python

Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. First released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasises code readability, notably using significant whitespace.

:::tip
If you don't know Python, why not try out Blockly? It's just as powerful, but lets you use a simple drag and drop interface to program the robot - and if you have any struggles with it, why not drop us [an email](mailto:robotics@hrsfc.ac.uk)! We want to make it as easy for you to get started as possible.

There are many resources online for learning Python, here are a few good ones that we would recommend:

<!--PI_EXTERNAL_LINK_WARNING-->

* [Student Robotics' tutorial](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/tutorials/python) has a tutorial called Python: a whirlwind tour. This was written for Student Robotics competitors (a similar competition to the one you are taking part in), and explains the basics while trying not to overwhelm you.
* [CSNewbs](https://www.csnewbs.com/python) has a very comprehensive tutorial, that takes you through from the basics to the slightly more advanced. The later chapters cover things like File Handling and UIs - you shouldn't be using these on your brains, but go wild on your own devices!
* [The Official Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/) can be pretty handy - the good stuff starts at chapter 3, but you should at least skim the stuff before it; there is a lot there and it may be a little overwhelming.
* A number of tutorials for beginners are linked to from [here](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers).
* [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/) is quite nice if you've programmed before in another language and just want to learn the syntax. (Tip: If you're trying to complete the challenges, here's where we say you can learn Python in "Y" minutes)
* [The Official Docs](https://docs.python.org/) can be handy, but a little dense! Give them a shot, but don't worry if you can't find what you are looking for.

:::warning
Running code on your brain may have unintended side effects if it does not call `import robot`, and doesn't create a robot object (`R = robot.Robot()`). Its best to leave those lines in, even if you don't need to run anything related to the hardware on the brain.
