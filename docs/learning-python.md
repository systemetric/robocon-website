# Learning Python

Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. First released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasises code readability, notably using significant whitespace.

If you don't know Python, why not try out Blockly? It's just as powerful, but lets you use a simple drag and drag interface to program the robot.

There are many resources online for learning Python, here are a few good ones.

* [Student Robotics's tutorial](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/tutorials/python), called Python: A whirlwind tour. This was written for Student Robotics competitors, and explains the basics while trying not to overwhelm you.
* [The Official Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/) – the good stuff starts at chapter 3, but you should at least skim the stuff before it; there is a lot there and it may be a little overwhelming.
* A number of tutorials for beginners are linked to from [here](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers).
* [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/) – quite nice if you've programmed before in another language and just want to learn the syntax.
* [The Official Docs](https://docs.python.org/2.7/), for the version of python on the BrainBox.
