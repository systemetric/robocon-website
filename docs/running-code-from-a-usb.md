# Running code from a USB

If you're unable to access Shepherd or the web editors you can copy robot code from a USB stick plugged into the robot. This is also useful is have you different programs you want to run in the arena that do different things.

1. Place a file called `main.py` or `code.zip` (which must include a file called `main.py`) in the root directory of the USB stick on another computer.
2. Turn the robot off.
3. Insert the USB stick.
4. Turn the robot on. The file will be copied from the USB stick and that code will be run instead.
