# Using the Editor

We recommend you use the code editor that's included with Shepherd to program your robot. You can either program in Python or use Blockly, a powerful Scratch-like programming tool.

Assuming you've [connected to your robot](/connecting.md), head to <http://robot.local/editor> or click the orange
editor button on the Shepherd homepage.

## The Editor Interface

You should now see the editor interface. _(yours will look slightly different to this)_

The **<span style="color: #00A510">green sidebar</span>** is the **projects panel**. This is where you can access or
export your existing projects, and create or import new ones. Clicking on a project in this list will open it in the
editor.

* The **<span style="color: #FF6A00">orange button</span>** is the **import button**. This lets you load a saved project
  into the editor.
* The **<span style="color: #0094FF">blue button</span>** is the **create project button**. This is how you
  [create a project](#creating-a-new-project).
* The **<span style="color: #FF0000">red button</span>** is the **export button**. This allows you to save the project
  to your computer as a backup.
* The **<span style="color: #FF00DC">pink button</span>** is the **delete project button**. This will allow you to
  delete a project if you don't want it. There is no way to undo this action.

The **<span style="color: #FFD800">yellow toolbar</span>** is the **tab list**. This is where you can find all your open
projects. If your project has a **white circle** at the end of the tab, it means you have **unsaved** content. Projects are
auto-saved after you stop editing them or when you run your project, but you can also manually save by pressing the **CTRL**
and **S** keys simultaneously.

The **<span style="color: #007F7F">teal sidebar</span>** is the **logs panel**. This is where you can see the output
from your robot when you run your program.

* The **<span style="color: #006327">dark green button</span>** is the **run button**. Pressing this will prompt you to
  save your project to your computer, just as a backup, and then run your code on the robot.
* The **<span style="color: #630000">dark red button</span>** is the **stop button**. Pressing this will force the robot
  to stop what it's doing, useful if your robot is out of control.

The **main section** in the middle is the **editor**. This will be different depending on whether you're editing a Python or a
Blockly project.

## Creating a new project

Click on the **create project button** (marked in **<span style="color: #0094FF">blue</span>** in the above screenshot).
The create project dialog will appear:

Give your project a name, then select the type of project you would like. Choose either Python or Blockly. Then click the **create** button.

Your new project will open in the editor. See the sections below for more information on [Python](#python-projects) and
[Blockly](#blockly-projects) projects. Once you've read these, why not start learning [how to program your robot](/init-robot.md). 

## Python Projects

Python projects provide a powerful development tool with syntax highlighting and code completion for the standard Python libraries and also the `robot` module. If you are interested, it uses the text editor that powers Visual Studio Code.

## Blockly Projects

Google's Blockly is a programming environment similar to Scratch that allows you to program your robot with blocks. You still have access to all the features of the robot so you are not disadvantaged if you decide to use this over Python.
