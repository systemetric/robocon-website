# Collecting Images and Raw Analysis

Every time the robot takes a picture it is updated on the web interface, during development it is occasionally useful to be able to also keep a log of pictures that have been analysed to check the camera focus, motion blur etc.

## Gathering Data:

1. Add a file with the name "collect_images.txt" to the USB stick to collect the images
2. Add a file with the name "log_markers.txt" to the USB stick to collect analysis of images
3. Insert the USB stick before turning the robot on
4. Remember to fully shut down the robot before removing the USB stick

:::warning

Collecting all images may slow down the processing time from your robot - Use with care!
