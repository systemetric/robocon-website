![Come to the techday](/images/IMG_20181117_151451.jpg)

We would like to announce that we are going to be holding a tech-day at 11:00 on Saturday the 16th of February. 

You can bring your robot and any problems you might have and we will have people on hand to help you. We will also have a mock arena setup for you to test your robot in a similar environment to the real competition. The event will be held in the same building as the kick-off (see the map). If you plan to come weâ€™d appreciate you entering your team name at the [link here](https://goo.gl/forms/GEVP49AECOWrxLHb2) so that we have an idea of numbers.
