Today we welcomed 15 teams from 10 schools at our kickoff event for RoboCon 2025.

The day started with a presentation from three of our students about this year's competition 'Dragon's Lair'. In this game, the arena is split into 4 terretories, each owned by a dragon (a RoboCon robot) with it's own lair at the back of the territory (a plinth raised 15 cm above the arena floor). Each dragon has its' own Gem but this gem is in another dragon's terretory, and it needs to get it's gems back to its' lair. Additionally, 

The students then got to complete a set of mini challenges. These challenges are a great way to explore the capabilities of our new spud-tacular version 3 BrainBoxes.    

We wish this year's teams the best of luck with their robot building.
