Your data may also be used to help with event planning of RoboCon.
## Data accuracy & retention

By contributing to the site you agree to us using your data for any purpose concerning RoboCon and irrevocably give us rights to use and modify it without credit, however you retain ownership of the content.
Under the GDPR you are given a set of rights. We will work to ensure that all of these rights are given to you. If you feel that a right has been violated and would like to lodge a complaint please contact us.

We share your data with Google for analytics and authentication purposes. In order for Google to process this data it may be sent to the United States of America. We will ensure that we comply with both legalisation for the UK and USA.
## Your requirements to provide data
Using the website requires us to provide you with a service. This service cannot and will not be provided unless all data which is requested is given to Hills Road Robotics, with the exception of usage data of the site. We will be unable to allow you to use the site unless you provide this data.
## Automated decision making
We automatically deduce which the group which you come from based on the registration code which you use. By entering the registration code and having agreed to this privacy statement you are explicitly agreeing to us deducing this information. 
## Data Security
We are committed to ensuring that your data is kept secure. We will use modern and secure standards of data encryption for storing sensitive data such and passwords. However any data that you post publically to the site will be publically accessible.
## Processing Minors information
We are aware that a large percentage of the users of this site are minors and as such we monitor posts closely to ensure that we are able to protect their interests. We design our processing with children in mind from the outset, and use a data protection by design and by default approach. When relying on 'necessary for the performance of a contract', we consider the child's competence to understand what they are agreeing to, and to enter into a contract. When relying on consent, we make sure that the child understands what they are consenting to, and we do not exploit any imbalance of power in the relationship between us. When relying upon 'legitimate interests', we take responsibility for identifying the risks and consequences of the processing, and put age appropriate safeguards in place.
## Data Protection Officer
As we are not an incorporated entity we are not legally required to have a DPO or a data controller. However you may contact us with any queries and we will attempt to resolve the role of a DPO.
