# Why STEM?

> Scientific and technological innovations have become increasingly important as we face the benefits and challenges of both globalization and a knowledge-based economy. To succeed in this new information-based and highly technological society, students need to develop their capabilities in STEM

# Why extracurricular?

Since 2016 GCSEs have become more academic, depriving students of any opportunity to learn how to put theory in to practice. Therefore there is a need to promote STEM actively outside of lessons to ensure that students feel willing and able to choose STEM based A-levels. This ensures students are not blocked from STEM career paths further down the line.

# Why RoboCon?

RoboCon aims to fill a gap left by many STEM outreach activities. It provides a long term project where the students can explore the engineering process of design, test and improvement. It aims to provide a task where there is no "correct" solution and students can put their ideas into practice.

Our competition, is designed to be ultra-accessible for GCSE students at schools with few resources. With support from corporate sponsors such as yourself, we will be able to provide student teams with a kit to build a simple but easily upgradeable robot to get them started. The kit includes a Hills Road student assembled "brain" enabling the robots to operate autonomously based on computer vision, and a tablet PC which allows GCSE students to program the robot without relying on school infrastructure. We also provide the instructions and rules for the competition. We do not charge any of the schools to enter the competition or attend our events.
